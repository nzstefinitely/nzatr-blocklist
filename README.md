Aotearoa Twitter 'Alt'-Right Block List. People on this list have been blocked because I wished to remoev the following things from my Twitter experience: 

- Rumour spreading
- Fake news spreading
- Climate-change denial
- Men's rights activism 
- Harassment
- Doxxing
- General abuse and nastiness. 

It is entirely subjective. Not every one on this list is guilt of all of the above. It is not a case of blocking anyone that holds alternative views.

With that said, here's the Aotearoa Twitter 'Alt'-Right Block List.

Download the most recent CSV and follow the ‘how to import someone’s block list’ instructions from here:

This will block these users on your Twitter account.
