# Aotearoa Negative Tweeters Block List
Aotearoa Negative Tweeters Block List. People on this list have been blocked because I wished to remove the following things from my Twitter experience: 

- Rumours
- Fake news 
- Climate-change denial
- Men's rights activism 
- Harassment
- Doxxing
- Trolling
- General abuse and nastiness. 

It is entirely subjective. Not every one on this list is guilty of all of the above. It is not a case of blocking anyone that holds alternative views. I am not claiming that anyone on this list is guilty of anything. 

## How to use the block list

[Download the CSV](https://github.com/nzstefinitely/nzatr-blocklist/blob/master/nzatr_blocklist_20180509.csv) and follow Twitter's ['How to import someone elseâ€™s block list'](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-block-options) instructions: 

**To import a block list:**

1. Make sure the file shared with you is a .csv file and save it to your computer.
2. Navigate to your [blocked account settings](https://twitter.com/settings/blocked) on twitter.com.
3. Click the **Advanced options** drop-down menu.
4. Select **Import a list.**
5. In the pop-up, click on **Attach a file** to upload and find the .csv file. Click Open to import the list.
6. The file name will be displayed when the file has been successfully imported.
7. Click **Preview**. The list of the accounts will be displayed. You can uncheck any accounts you do not wish to block (accounts that you currently follow will be automatically unchecked).
8. Click **Block** to confirm.
9. The imported accounts will be added to your block list.
