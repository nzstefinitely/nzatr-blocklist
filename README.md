Aotearoa Twitter 'Alt'-Right Block List
There exists a group of NZ Twitter users who are, in my opinion, prone to fake-news, abusive behaviour, defamation, doxxing, harrassment and other activities which many may want to avoid. 

With that in mind here's what I called the Aotearoa Twitter Right Block List.

Download the most recent CSV and follow the ‘how to import someone’s block list’ instructions from here: 

https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-block-options

This will block these users on your Twitter account.
